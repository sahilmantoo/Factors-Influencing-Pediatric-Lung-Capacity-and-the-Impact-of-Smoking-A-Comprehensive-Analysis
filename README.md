Factors Influencing Pediatric Lung Capacity and the Impact of Smoking: A Comprehensive Analysis
This repository presents a data science project that investigates the factors affecting pediatric lung capacity, with a special focus on the impact of smoking exposure (both active and passive). Using machine learning models (primarily CatBoostRegressor), the project aims to predict lung capacity, analyze key predictors, and quantify the role of smoking in lung function development.
