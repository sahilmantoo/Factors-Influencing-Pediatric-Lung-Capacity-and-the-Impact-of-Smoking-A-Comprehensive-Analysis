Factors Influencing Pediatric Lung Capacity and the Impact of Smoking: A Comprehensive Analysis
This repository presents a data science project that investigates the factors affecting pediatric lung capacity, with a special focus on the impact of smoking exposure (both active and passive). Using machine learning models (primarily CatBoostRegressor), the project aims to predict lung capacity, analyze key predictors, and quantify the role of smoking in lung function development.

# 📌 Objectives

- Predict lung capacity in children using health, lifestyle, and demographic data.
- Evaluate the impact of smoking exposure on lung function.
- Identify the most important features influencing pediatric lung capacity.
- Tune machine learning models (CatBoost) for optimal performance while preventing overfitting.

# ⚙️ Setup & Installation
## 1️⃣ Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/sahilmantoo/Factors-Influencing-Pediatric-Lung-Capacity-and-the-Impact-of-Smoking-A-Comprehensive-Analysis.git
- cd Factors-Influencing-Pediatric-Lung-Capacity-and-the-Impact-of-Smoking-A-Comprehensive-Analysis

## 2️⃣ Install dependencies:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3️⃣ Software Version
- pip 23.0.1
- Python 3.10.15
## 4️⃣ 📁 DataSet
- This project uses the **Lung Capacity of Kids** dataset, available on Kaggle:
  * [🔗 Lung Capacity of Kids Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacopoferretti/lung-capacity-of-kids)

# 📈 Key Insights
- Smoking exposure significantly reduces predicted lung capacity in children.
- Age, height, weight, and environmental conditions also play important roles.
- A simple, well-regularized CatBoost model (depth=1) achieved strong predictive performance (R² ≈ 0.85).
